    <div id="introduction">
        <p>After taking a long sabbatical to travel and develop my skills as a physical artist, I'm ready to return to the digital world and continue my software engineering career. I am a team-oriented web developer with nearly 10 years of experience that thrives on collaboration. I am excited to bring my empathetic approach to your software team to make web applications that are beautiful, highly-functional, and easy-to-maintain.</p>

<h3 id="simplecharactersheet">Simple Character Sheet</h3>
<h4 id="simplecharactersheetcomhttpssimplecharactersheetcom"><a href="https://simplecharactersheet.com">simplecharactersheet.com</a></h4>
<p>I play a lot of TTRPGs that <em>aren't</em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons. They usually require that you print out bespoke character sheets for each game. In an attempt to save paper, I created this React app to digitally recreate these printouts. This is a serverless application lets players create character sheets without logging in so that players can get right to the game. </p>
<h3 id="lasercutart">Laser Cut Art</h3>
<h4 id="paularmerwebsitehttpspaularmerwebsite"><a href="https://paularmer.website">paularmer.website</a></h4>
<p>Over the last few years I've been developing my skills as a physical artist. I've grown to love laser cut woodworking, mostly making game tokens and organizers for my friends. While it's not software development, it's been a great exercise in managing product requirements. I want to make cool, attractive art that is also solves the gaming needs of my friends.</p>
<h3 id="pandemiclegacyboardgametracker">Pandemic: Legacy Board Game Tracker</h3>
<h4 id="pandemiclegacytrackercomhttpspandemiclegacytrackercom"><a href="https://pandemiclegacytracker.com">pandemiclegacytracker.com</a></h4>
<p>My friends and I are competitive nerds. So when we were playing this legacy board game, I decided to create an application that would help us count the cards in the game deck. It was a really exciting challenge to not only construct the prediction engine, but connect that to a UI that was easy to use while playing the physical card game.</p>
