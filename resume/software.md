After taking a long sabbatical to travel and develop my skills as a physical artist, I'm ready to return to the digital world and continue my software engineering career. I am a team-oriented web developer with nearly 10 years of experience that thrives on collaboration. I am excited to bring my empathetic approach to your software team to make web applications that are beautiful, highly-functional, and easy-to-maintain.
