<p><p>Following my tenure at Autodesk, I took a deliberate break to travel and explore new professional avenues. During this time, I pursued a variety of courses including art classes to deepen my proficiency in creative expression. Now, I'm eager to leverage my renewed creativity in my next role as a Product Manager. I hope to bring my empathetic organizational style and my holistic problem-solving to elevate your company.</p></p>
