## Dev
To develop locally, you'll need to run scripts to build the HTML and CSS. 

### Watch SCSS files
```
$ npm run watch-styles
```
### Watch HTML templates and markdown files
```
$ npm run watch-md
```

Then you can serve the site on [localhost:6969](http://localhost:6969) by running:
```
$ npm run start
```

## Deploy
To deploy to Github Pages, make sure everything is pushed to `main`. Then you can run:

```
$ npm run deploy
```
