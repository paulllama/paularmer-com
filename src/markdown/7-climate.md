I am making SF a greener, future-proof city through the [SF Climate Emergency Coalition](https://www.sfclimateemergency.org/). Our little group has helped the board pass the [All-Electric Building Ordinace](https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/No-more-gas-stoves-California-prepares-to-16161119.php) for all new construction. We also helped the Department of the Environment (SFE) get funded out of the general funds for the first time in SF history.

I look forward to continue working with the Board to reach net-zero by 2040.
