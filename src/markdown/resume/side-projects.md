### Simple Character Sheet

I play a lot of TTRPGs that *aren't* Dungeons & Dragons that pretty much require you to print out character sheets. So in attempt to save paper, I created this React app to digitally recreate these printouts. The goal is to add support for all the games that I run for my friends. 

### Pandemic: Legacy Board Game Tracker

My friends and I are nerds, so we really wanted to do well as we played the Panedmic Legacy board game. I ended up building a probability engine helps predict and visualize the next cards to be drawn from the deck. 

### Personal Website
#### [paularmer.website](https://paularmer.website)
It started as just some static HTML, but slowly turned into a whole Node.js build pipeline. My resume is even rendered using assets from the website as part of the build scripts.
