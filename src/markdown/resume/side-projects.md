### Simple Character Sheet

I play a lot of TTRPGs that *aren't* Dungeons & Dragons. They usually require that you print out bespoke character sheets for each game. In an attempt to save paper, I created this React app to digitally recreate these printouts. This is a serverless application lets players create character sheets without logging in so that players can get right to the game. 

### Laser Cut Art

Over the last few years I've been developing my skills as a physical artist. I've grown to love laser cut woodworking, mostly making game tokens and organizers for my friends. While it's not software development, it's been a great exercise in managing product requirements. I want to make cool, attractive art that is also solves the gaming needs of my friends.

### Pandemic: Legacy Board Game Tracker

My friends and I are competitive nerds. So when we were playing this legacy board game, I decided to create an application that would help us count the cards in the game deck. It was a really exciting challenge to not only construct the prediction engine, but connect that to a UI that was easy to use while playing the physical card game.
