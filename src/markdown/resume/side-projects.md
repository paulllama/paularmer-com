### Simple Character Sheet

I play a lot of TTRPGs that *aren't* Dungeons & Dragons that pretty much require you to print out character sheets. So in attempt to save paper, I created this React app to digitally recreate these printouts. The goal is to add support for all the games that I run for my friends. 

### Pandemic: Legacy Board Game Tracker

My friends and I are nerds, so we really wanted to do well as we played the Panedmic Legacy board game. I ended up building a probability engine helps predict and visualize the next cards to be drawn from the deck. 

### Laser Cut Art

Over the last few years I've been developing my skills as a physical artist. I've grown to love laser cut woodworking, mostly making game tokens and organizers for my friends. While it's not software development, it's been a great exercise in managing product requirements. I want to make cool, attractive art that is also solves the gaming needs of my friends.
