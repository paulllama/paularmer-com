title: Simple Character Sheet

I play a lot of TTRPGs that *aren't* Dungeons & Dragons. While I love handing out paper character sheets to my players, I have been known to forget to bring the character sheets to a session or two. So instead of printing out character sheets, I have them create them on this little app I made.
