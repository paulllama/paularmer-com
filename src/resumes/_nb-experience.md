### Noisebridge Volunteer Member
*NoiseBridge is a community hackerspace in San Francisco, focused on providing a space for technical, artistic, and educational projects.*
- Here, I create some of my art projects, focusing mostly on laser-cut woodwork. 
- In order to contribute to this "egalitarian do-ocracy", I volunteer time to teach skills to other members. 
- Recently I've been assisting with event planning for this community's upcoming public events.
