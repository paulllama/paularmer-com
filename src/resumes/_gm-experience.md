### TTRPG Game Master
- Led multiple year-long campaigns across various TTRPG systems, crafting storylines and adapting gameplay mechanics to provide consistent challenges and fun for my players.
- Organized and facilitated regular gaming sessions for my adult friends with a shared lore library to make information sharing easy.
- Fostered a collaborative and inclusive gaming environment with safety features like X-card and Lines/Veils, to encourage vulnerability and expressive roleplay.
